                <h3>1. Trowel</h3>
                <p>
                    A trowel is a versatile tool for digging, planting, and weeding. Its pointed blade makes it ideal for working in small spaces and is essential for planting bulbs and seedlings.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Pruning Shears</h3>
                <p>
                    Pruning shears are used to trim and shape plants, removing dead or overgrown branches. They help improve plant health and encourage better growth and flowering.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Garden Fork</h3>
                <p>
                    A garden fork is excellent for turning soil, breaking up clumps, and aerating the ground. It’s useful for preparing garden beds and mixing in compost or other soil amendments.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Spade</h3>
                <p>
                    A spade is ideal for digging and edging. Its flat blade allows for precise cutting of soil and grass, making it perfect for creating garden beds and borders.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Watering Can</h3>
                <p>
                    A watering can is essential for delivering water to your plants, especially in areas where a hose is impractical. Choose a can with a detachable spout for versatility.
                </p>
                <h3>6. Gloves</h3>
                <p>
                    Gardening gloves protect your hands from dirt, thorns, and other potential hazards. They provide a better grip on tools and prevent blisters during extended gardening sessions.
                </p>
                <h3>7. Rake</h3>
                <p>
                    A rake is used for leveling soil, collecting leaves, and clearing debris. It’s an important tool for keeping your garden tidy and preparing the soil for planting.
